Just some notes on git ...
Install git from git-scm.com

Create folder and put stuff in it.
# git init
# git add <filename>    # add <filename>
# git add .             # add all files in folder
# git status            # show added / not added / changed files
# git commit -m "stuff" # need to add a comment when committing

Create a .gitinogre file in the root of the folder
In this file, "filename" (without the ") to ignore that file, and "/dir" to ignore a dir completely
git status will not show the ignored files and folders.

GitHub: go there and create an account.
Create new repository in there and give a description
Private projects are paid $7/month or $25/month for a 5-user project
Note that you can have unlimited *private* Gists though.

Create a README.md (MarkDown) to display project info.
Copy the link (something like https://github.com/roysubs/myproject)
Add .git to the end of that

# git remote add origin https://github.com/roysubs/myproject.git

# git remote   # will say "origin"

# git push -u origin master   # will prompt for credentials then push to the "myproject" repo
The project will now show the files: https://github.com/roysubs/myproject

After this, can just do:
# git push

To clone another repo, copy the link to clone the repo.
Open a git console.
# git clone <paste-line-here>
Note!: The folder will be created *under* this level and in that folder the entire project will be there.

==========

# git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
    # Had to do this to force the merge to happen.
# git clone https://github.com/roysubs/psprofile.git

git checkout master
git merge <stuff>
