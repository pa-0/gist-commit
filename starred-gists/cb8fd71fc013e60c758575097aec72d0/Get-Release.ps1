function Get-PrivateRelease {
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Download a release from a GitHub repository.

		.DESCRIPTION
			This function will download a release artifact from a GitHub repository using a Personal Access Token (PAT)
			This repository can be either public or private.

		.PARAMETER OwnerName
			Name of owner of repository. For example, for the repository PowerShell/vscode-powershell, the owner is "PowerShell".

		.PARAMETER RepositoryName
			Name of repository. For example, for the repository PowerShell/vscode-powershell, the repository is "vscode-powershell".

		.PARAMETER Asset
			Use if there is more than one asset in the release, such as if a release has separate Windows and MacOS releases.
			By default, Get-PrivateRelease will download the highest release in the list. This parameter is a number of assets to skip.
			For example, to get the seventh asset from the top, use -Asset 6.

		.PARAMETER DestinationPath
			The path that the downloaded files will be saved to. If the given path does not exist, it will be created automatically.
			By default, this path is a folder called "Release Assets" within the folder running the script.

		.PARAMETER SkipExisting
			If this is true, the script will skip over files for downloading if they already exist in the target folder.
			This is set to true by default. Set to false to overwrite existing files.

		.EXAMPLE
			Get-PrivateRelease -Owner Lycaon37 -Repo PZ-Improved-Komodo

			Download PZ-Improved-Komodo.zip

		.EXAMPLE
			Get-PrivateRelease -Owner ciderapp -Repo cider-releases -Asset 6

			Download the .snap release of Cider."

function Get-HTTPRelease {
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Download a file from a website through Regular Expression (regex) filtering.

		.DESCRIPTION
			This function will download a file from a website using regular expressions. It was intended to find software releases, but it can be used with any file if desired.
			Given a certain base URL and a regular expression, it will dynamically find a specific file.
			This only functions with websites that define links statically via http, and not dynamically with javascript.

		.PARAMETER URL
			The URL link to the website where the file is hosted.

		.PARAMETER Pattern
			The regular expression pattern to search for the file.

		.PARAMETER Asset
			Use if there is more than one fie matching the regular expression. The script will skip the number results found by the asset parameter.
			By default, Get-HTTPRelease will download the highest release in the list. This parameter is a number of assets to skip.
			For example, to get the seventh asset from the top, use -Asset 6.

		.PARAMETER DestinationPath
			The path that the downloaded files will be saved to. If the given path does not exist, it will be created automatically.
			By default, this path is a folder called "Release Assets" within the folder running the script.

		.PARAMETER SkipExisting
			If this is true, the script will skip over files for downloading if they already exist in the target folder.
			This is set to true by default. Set to false to overwrite existing files.

		.EXAMPLE
			Get-PublicRelease -URL https://dolphin-emu.org/download/ -Pattern *dolphin-master-5.0-*-x64.7z
			Download the latest beta Dolphin Emulator release for Windows.
