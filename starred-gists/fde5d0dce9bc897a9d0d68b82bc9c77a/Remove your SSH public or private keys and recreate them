#How to remove your SSH public/private keys, recreate them, and then add your newly created public key to the servers and online services you use.

#Remove your SSH public/private keys:
rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa*

#Recreate the keypair, choosing a new passphrase:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

#Add the newly created private key to your OS X Keychain to store the passphrase and manage unlocking it automatically:
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

#Copy the public key to the OS X clipboard for adding to web services like GitHub, etc.
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

#Add your newly created public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the remote server. Be sure to ensure the correct permissions of both the remote ~/.ssh folder (700) and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (600). You may want to investigate using ssh-copy-id to ease this process.
