## How To Use

1. While focused on an open window (like a browser or editor), hit the "record" hotkey (default: `win+ctrl+shift+?`) to add an app to the focus cycle list. Tooltips will pop up notifying you of recorded apps, or if there's an issue recording.

2. To cycle forward through recorded apps, use the "cycle forward" hotkey (default: `win+ctrl+shift+>`), or click the system-tray icon, or click the menu Item "Cycle Apps" menu item.

3. To cycle backward, use the "cycle backward" hotkey (default: `win+ctrl+shift+<`).
